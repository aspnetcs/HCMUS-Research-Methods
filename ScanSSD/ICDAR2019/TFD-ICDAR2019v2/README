Changes in Version 2
--------------------

In this dataset problems with ICDAR2019 TFD dataset are fixed. Character level annotations were fitted to characters. Few missing bounding boxes for math were added.  
IOU_lib was updated to support file-level results and allows us to specify different IOU thresholds. 
It allows page numbers to be floating-point page numbers and supports both .math and .csv files.
