\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this paper, we presented our solution to the problem of mathematical formula detection in PDF documents. Our method was implemented with Faster R-CNN with ResNet50 as the backbone and improved by Feature Pyramid Network. We used about a quarter of the IBEM dataset for training, validation, and testing. Our model has significant results, with the highest F1-score being more than $90\%$ when tested with 3 configs on this dataset.

In the future, we intend to improve our model so that it can give better results when working with larger datasets. Moreover, based on this model, we want to build a model which can detect mathematical formulas in both PDF documents and image documents, as well as the model can transfer those formulas to \LaTeX commands, making it more convenient for people to re-type their scientific documents to \LaTeX.
