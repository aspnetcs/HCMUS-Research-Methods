For many years, the detection of mathematical formulas has been recognized as a difficult task \cite{Chan2000}. There are several existing methods for detecting mathematical expressions in PDF documents using formatting information, for example page layout, character labels, character locations, font sizes, etc.  However, there are many different tools for generating PDF documents, and there are a variant in their character quality. Lin el al. \cite{Lin2011} shows that mathematical formulas can be a composition of some object types. For instance, the square root sign in a PDF generated by \LaTeX consists of the text object representing a radical sign and a graphical object for the horizontal line, which results the fact that some symbols must be identified from multiple drawing elements \cite{Mali2020}. \\
