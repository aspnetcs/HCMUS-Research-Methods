\section*{Acknowledgment}
This paper and the research behind it would not have been finished unless there was brilliant support from our mentor, Mr. Dang Nguyen Hai. His enthusiasm, knowledge, and exacting attention to detail have been an inspiration and kept our work on track from our first approach to this topic to the final draft of this paper.

We show our gratitude to Assoc. Prof. Minh-Triet Tran and Assoc. Prof. Quan Vu Hai for sharing their pearls of wisdom with us during the course of this research, and we also thank them for their reviews of this paper.

We would also like to thank our classmates at the University of Science, Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City, who have looked over our manuscript and answered a variety of questions from us.

We are also immensely grateful to our friends for their comments on an earlier version of this transcription, although any errors are our own.
