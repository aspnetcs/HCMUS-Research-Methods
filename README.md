# HCMUS - Research Methods
We are from [fit@hcmus](https://www.fit.hcmus.edu.vn/vn/), and this repository stores our project for the Scientific Research Methods (CSC14008) course.  
For more information, please follow the content below.  
# 1. Topic
Our topic is to develop a model that detects mathematical formulas in pdf documents.
# 2. Method  
We use Faster R-CNN with ResNet50 as the backbone for our model. Moreover, the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) module is used to improve our solution.  
# 3. Results
For details about results, please navigate to our paper [here](https://github.com/vanloc1808/HCMUS-Research-Methods/blob/main/paper/main.pdf).
# 4. Code
We use Kaggle to create our [notebook](https://github.com/vanloc1808/HCMUS-Research-Methods/blob/main/icdar2021/icdar2021-test.ipynb).
